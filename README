# AIM Django Demo Project

The project consists of 3 reports, where one report can be drilled down to the next level. 

## Install

  - create a new venv eg. `virtualenv -p python3 /path/to/myenv`
  - install dependencies from requirements.txt

## Tasks

  1) Write a custom django admin command to ingest demo data eg. `python manage.py ingest demo_data.csv`

  2) On the main page show a table with the following columns:
    - date
    - sum(revenue)
    - sum(clicks)

    (make sure revenue and clicks are aggregated by date)

  3) When clicked on the date show another table with the following columns:
    - publisher name
    - sum(revenue)
    - sum(clicks)

    (only show data for the selected day, data should be aggregated by publisher name)
  
  4) When clicked on the publisher name show a table with the following columns:
    - source
    - sum(revenue)
    - sum(clicks)

    (only show data for selected publisher and day)
